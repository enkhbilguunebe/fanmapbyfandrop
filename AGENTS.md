- Map uses maplibre-gl v4 (v6 worker breaks under Vite prebundling) with OpenFreeMap/Esri keyless styles; MapView is lazy + ClientOnly because it touches window.
- Demo state lives in a persisted zustand store (src/lib/store.ts, skipHydration + rehydrate in __root) until Lovable Cloud is enabled; demo data in src/lib/demo-data.ts is fictional.
